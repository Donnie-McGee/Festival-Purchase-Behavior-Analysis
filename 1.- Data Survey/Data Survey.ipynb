    "\n",

    "   Do any fields contain typos, extra spaces, or inconsistent formatting? Which columns need standarization?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Distributions**  \n",
    "   How do values distribute across key fields (e.g. satisfaction, ticket type, group size)? Do they appear natural or artificially uniform?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Consistency**  \n",
    "   Are related columns logically aligned?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Field Types and Optimization**  \n",
    "   Are the column data types appropriate? Can I optimize memory or performance through type conversion?\n",

    "6. **Outliers and Edge Cases**  \n",

They contain only high, rounded values (e.g., 5.0, 6.5, 8.0, 9.5) with identical categories across all three fields. This pattern suggests artificiality and calls for a more natural spread of scores, including lower and more varied ratings."
