# Python Phase

This first phase is divided in 4 smaller steps:

1. [Data Survey](https://github.com/Donnie-McGee/Festival-Purchase-Behavior-Analysis/tree/main/1.-%20Python%20Phase/1.-%20Data%20Survey):  
Have a quick overview of the whole dataset, looking for null values, typos,  duplicates and other errors within my data, paying attention to fields' distributions.
2. [Data Sharpening](https://github.com/Donnie-McGee/Festival-Purchase-Behavior-Analysis/tree/main/1.-%20Python%20Phase/2.-%20Data%20Sharpening):  
Modify the dataset to bring it closer to a realistic experience. Here, I customized distributions and add variety.
3. [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/Donnie-McGee/Festival-Purchase-Behavior-Analysis/tree/main/1.-%20Python%20Phase/3.-%20Data%20Cleaning):  
Null values management, adding consistency to different fields, correcting typos and strimming values, verifying clean columns and data convertion.
4.- [Data Modelling](https://github.com/Donnie-McGee/Festival-Purchase-Behavior-Analysis/tree/main/1.-%20Python%20Phase/4.-%20Data%20Modelling):  
Here I created new columns, created fact and dim tables and changed fields' types.
