# Music-Festival-Analysis

## Description

This project explores the purchasing behavior of attendees at a 3-day music festival in May 2025. Using a synthetic dataset of 14,000 entries, the goal is to understand how ticket type choices relate to other attendee characteristics and behaviors.

## Objective

To analyze how the type of ticket purchased (e.g., General, VIP, Full Pass) reflects differences in attendee profiles, payment preferences, attendance patterns, and overall satisfaction. The aim is to provide actionable insights to event organizers and marketing teams.

### Key Business Questions

- How do ticket preferences vary by age, gender, and musical taste?
- Are certain ticket types associated with specific payment methods?
- Does group size influence the total spending during the festival?
- Does the type of ticket influence the likelihood to recommend the festival?
- Is there a correlation between overall experience ratings and the likelihood to recommend the festival?

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas & NumPy)
- SQL
- Git/GitHub
- CSV files (raw and cleaned versions)
- Power BI
